# TEB93D - Red Hat OpenShift Service Mesh in Action
Thank you for signing up for an attending the lab on Red Hat OpenShift Service Mesh.

## Getting Started
The machine you are sitting at has the OpenShift CLI installed. Since the
Service Mesh lab is running against OpenShift Container Platform 4, you will
need to use `oc4` to interact with the API server.

You can login using the following command:

[source,bash,role="copypaste"]
----
oc4 login -u kubeadmin -p {{ KUBEADMIN_PASSWORD }} {{ API_URL }}
----

The OpenShift Web Console is also available to you at the following URL:

[source,role="copypaste"]
----
{{ MASTER_URL }}
----

You can login with:

----
Username: kubeadmin
Password: {{ KUBEADMIN_PASSWORD }}
----

Now you are ready for the first lab. Click **Go To Next Module** to continue!
