# This is the lab guide
Congratulations! If you've gotten this far, you are ready to move on to the
first real exercise! Good luck!

### Opening more Terminals

If you need to open up more terminal windows during the lab, you'll again need
to use the `connect.sh` script to connect to the environment before executing
commands in the exercises:

~~~bash
bash connect.sh {{ISTIO_LAB_HOSTNAME}}
~~~

Then:

~~~bash
sudo -E -i
cd $ISTIO_LAB_HOME
~~~

In the first lab you'll use Istio to intelligently route traffic. Click **Go To
